        "# Introduction\n",
        "article = '\\'\\'\\'Debugging\\'\\'\\' is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.  \\n\\nNumerous books have been written about debugging (see below: #Further reading|Further reading), as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, Logfile|log files, monitoring (Application monitoring|application, System Monitoring|system), memory dumps, Profiling (computer programming)|profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes.\\n\\nOrigin\\nA computer log entry from the Mark&nbsp;II, with a moth taped to the page\\n\\nThe terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s.[http://foldoc.org/Grace+Hopper Grace Hopper]  from FOLDOC While she was working on a Harvard Mark II|Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system. However the term \"bug\" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion), and \"debugging\" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers. Indeed, in an interview Grace Hopper remarked that she was not coining the term{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The moth fit the already existing terminology, so it was saved.  A letter from J. Robert Oppenheimer (director of the WWII atomic bomb \"Manhattan\" project at Los Alamos, NM) used the term in a letter to Dr. Ernest Lawrence at UC Berkeley, dated October 27, 1944,http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/physics/images/bigscience25.jpg regarding the recruitment of additional technical staff.\\n\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary entry for \"debug\" quotes the term \"debugging\" used in reference to airplane engine testing in a 1945 article in the Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society. An article in \"Airforce\" (June 1945 p.&nbsp;50) also refers to debugging, this time of aircraft cameras.  Hopper\\'s computer bug|bug was found on September 9, 1947. The term was not adopted by computer programmers until the early 1950s.\\nThe seminal article by GillS. Gill, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/98663 The Diagnosis of Mistakes in Programmes on the EDSAC], Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 206, No. 1087 (May 22, 1951), pp. 538-554 in 1951 is the earliest in-depth discussion of programming errors, but it does not use the term \"bug\" or \"debugging\".\\nIn the Association for Computing Machinery|ACM\\'s digital library, the term \"debugging\" is first used in three papers from 1952 ACM National Meetings.Robert V. D. Campbell, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=609784.609786 Evolution of automatic computation], Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p 29-32, 1952.Alex Orden, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=609784.609793 Solution of systems of linear inequalities on a digital computer], Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p. 91-95, 1952.Howard B. Demuth, John B. Jackson, Edmund Klein, N. Metropolis, Walter Orvedahl, James H. Richardson, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=800259.808982 MANIAC], Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Toronto), p. 13-16 Two of the three use the term in quotation marks.\\nBy 1963 \"debugging\" was a common enough term to be mentioned in passing without explanation on page 1 of the Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS manual.[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/ctss/CTSS_ProgrammersGuide.pdf The Compatible Time-Sharing System], M.I.T. Press, 1963\\n\\nKidwell\\'s article \\'\\'Stalking the Elusive Computer Bug\\'\\'Peggy Aldrich Kidwell, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728224&isnumber=15706 Stalking the Elusive Computer Bug], IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 1998. discusses the etymology of \"bug\" and \"debug\" in greater detail.\\n\\nScope\\nAs software and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system. The words \"anomaly\" and \"discrepancy\" can be used, as being more neutral terms, to avoid the words \"error\" and \"defect\" or \"bug\" where there might be an implication that all so-called \\'\\'errors\\'\\', \\'\\'defects\\'\\' or \\'\\'bugs\\'\\' must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment can be made to determine if changes to remove an \\'\\'anomaly\\'\\' (or \\'\\'discrepancy\\'\\') would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the change(s) unnecessary. Not all issues are life-critical or mission-critical in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long-term, than living with the known problem(s) (where the \"cure would be worse than the disease\"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a \"zero-defects\" mandate, where people might be tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero \\'\\'defects\\'\\'. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same \"bugs\" occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system.\\n\\nTools\\nDebugging on video game consoles is usually done with special hardware such as this Xbox (console)|Xbox debug unit intended for developers.\\n\\nDebugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates.  The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language(s) used and the available tools, such as \\'\\'debuggers\\'\\'. Debuggers are software tools which enable the programmer to monitor the execution (computers)|execution of a program, stop it, restart it, set breakpoints, and change values in memory. The term \\'\\'debugger\\'\\' can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging.\\n\\nGenerally, high-level programming languages, such as Java (programming language)|Java, make debugging easier, because they have features such as exception handling that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot. In programming languages such as C (programming language)|C or assembly language|assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and it is often difficult to see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugging|memory debugger tools may be needed.\\n\\nIn certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful.  These take the form of \\'\\'List of tools for static code analysis|static code analysis tools\\'\\'.  These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code.  All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers.  Some tools claim to be able to detect 300+ unique problems. Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages.  These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs.  A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs \\'\\'before\\'\\' the variable is assigned a value.  Another example would be to perform strong type checking when the language does not require such.  Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors.  As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives.  The old Unix \\'\\'Lint programming tool|lint\\'\\' program is an early example.\\n\\nFor debugging electronic hardware (e.g., computer hardware) as well as low-level software (e.g., BIOSes, device drivers) and firmware, instruments such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers or in-circuit emulator|in-circuit emulators (ICEs) are often used, alone or in combination.  An ICE may perform many of the typical software debugger\\'s tasks on low-level software and firmware.\\n\\nDebugging process \\nNormally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with Parallel computing|parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.\\n\\nAfter the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it Crash (computing)|crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be made manually, using a Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a Graphical user interface|GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.\\n\\nAfter the test case is sufficiently simplified, a programmer can use a debugger tool to examine program states (values of variables, plus the call stack) and track down the origin of the problem(s). Alternatively, Tracing (software)|tracing can be used. In simple cases, tracing is just a few print statements, which output the values of variables at certain points of program execution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\\n\\n Techniques \\n \\'\\'Interactive debugging\\'\\'\\n \\'\\'{{visible anchor|Print debugging}}\\'\\' (or tracing) is the act of watching (live or recorded) trace statements, or print statements, that indicate the flow of execution of a process. This is sometimes called \\'\\'{{visible anchor|printf debugging}}\\'\\', due to the use of the printf function in C. This kind of debugging was turned on by the command TRON in the original versions of the novice-oriented BASIC programming language. TRON stood for, \"Trace On.\" TRON caused the line numbers of each BASIC command line to print as the program ran.\\n \\'\\'Remote debugging\\'\\' is the process of debugging a program running on a system different from the debugger. To start remote debugging, a debugger connects to a remote system over a network. The debugger can then control the execution of the program on the remote system and retrieve information about its state.\\n \\'\\'Post-mortem debugging\\'\\' is debugging of the program after it has already Crash (computing)|crashed. Related techniques often include various tracing techniques (for example,[http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/185300443 Postmortem Debugging, Stephen Wormuller, Dr. Dobbs Journal, 2006]) and/or analysis of memory dump (or core dump) of the crashed process. The dump of the process could be obtained automatically by the system (for example, when process has terminated due to an unhandled exception), or by a programmer-inserted instruction, or manually by the interactive user.\\n \\'\\'\"Wolf fence\" algorithm:\\'\\' Edward Gauss described this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: \"There\\'s one wolf in Alaska; how do you find it? First build a fence down the middle of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point where you can see the wolf.\"<ref name=\"communications of the ACM\">{{cite journal | title=\"Pracniques: The \"Wolf Fence\" Algorithm for Debugging\", | author=E. J. Gauss | year=1982}} This is implemented e.g. in the Git (software)|Git version control system as the command \\'\\'git bisect\\'\\', which uses the above algorithm to determine which Commit (data management)|commit introduced a particular bug.\\n \\'\\'Delta Debugging\\'\\'{{snd}} a technique of automating test case simplification.Andreas Zeller: <cite>Why Programs Fail: A Guide to Systematic Debugging</cite>, Morgan Kaufmann, 2005.

Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. Not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed in different platforms.\\n\\nto identify and fix bugs in the system (e.g. logical or synchronization problems in the code, or a design error in the hardware);\\nto collect information about the operating states of the system that may then be used to analyze the system: to find ways to boost its performance or to optimize other important characteristics (e.g. energy consumption, reliability, real-time response etc.).\\n\\nAnti-debugging\\nAnti-debugging is \"the implementation of one or more techniques within computer code that hinders attempts at reverse engineering or debugging a target process\".<ref name=\"veracode-antidebugging\">{{cite web |url=http://www.veracode.com/blog/2008/12/anti-debugging-series-part-i/ |title=Anti-Debugging Series - Part I |last=Shields |first=Tyler |date=2008-12-02 |work=Veracode |accessdate=2009-03-17}} It is actively used by recognized publishers in copy protection|copy-protection schemas, but is also used by malware to complicate its detection and elimination.<ref name=\"soft-prot\">[http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~mgagnon/software_protection_through_anti_debugging.pdf Software Protection through Anti-Debugging Michael N Gagnon, Stephen Taylor, Anup Ghosh] Techniques used in anti-debugging include:\\nAPI-based: check for the existence of a debugger using system information\\nException-based: check to see if exceptions are interfered with\\nProcess and thread blocks: check whether process and thread blocks have been manipulated\\nModified code: check for code modifications made by a debugger handling software breakpoints\\nHardware- and register-based: check for hardware breakpoints and CPU registers\\nTiming and latency: check the time taken for the execution of instructions\\nDetecting and penalizing debugger<ref name=\"soft-prot\" /><!-- reference does not exist -->\\n\\nAn early example of anti-debugging existed in early versions of Microsoft Word which, if a debugger was detected, produced a message that said: \"The tree of evil bears bitter fruit.

That operation might signal one or more exceptions by invoking the default or, if explicitly requested, a language-defined alternate handling.\"\\n\\nBy default, an IEEE 754 exception is resumable and is handled by substituting a predefined value for different exceptions, e.g. infinity for a divide by zero exception, and providing floating point#Dealing with exceptional cases|status flags for later checking of whether the exception occurred (see C99#IEEE&nbsp;754 floating point support|C99 programming language for a typical example of handling of IEEE 754 exceptions). An exception-handling style enabled by the use of status flags involves: first computing an expression using a fast, direct implementation; checking whether it failed by testing status flags; and then, if necessary, calling a slower, more numerically robust, implementation.<ref name=\"Xiaoye Li and James Demmel 1994 983–992\">{{cite journal |author1=Xiaoye Li |author2=James Demmel | title=Faster Numerical Algorithms via Exception Handling, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 43(8) | year= 1994 | pages=983–992}}\\n\\nThe IEEE 754 standard uses the term \"trapping\" to refer to the calling of a user-supplied exception-handling routine on exceptional conditions, and is an optional feature of the standard.

For example, in 1996 the Ariane 5 Flight 501|maiden flight of the Ariane 5 (Flight 501) ended in a catastrophic explosion due in part to the Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language exception handling policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error, which in this case was a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit integer conversion Integer overflow|overflow.<ref name=grail /> In the Ariane Flight 501 case, the programmers protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow due to concerns about the computational constraints of the on-board computer and relied on what turned out to be incorrect assumptions about the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables because they code reuse|reused code from the Ariane 4, for which their assumptions were correct.http://www.irisa.fr/pampa/EPEE/Ariane5.html According to William Kahan, the loss of Flight 501 would have been avoided if the IEEE 754 exception-handling policy of default substitution had been used because the overflowing 64-bit to 16-bit conversion that caused the software to abort occurred in a piece of code that turned out to be completely unnecessary on the Ariane 5.<ref name=grail /> The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that \"An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the Fault-tolerant computer system|mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required Attitude control|attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment.\"https://www.ima.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/ariane5rep.html\\n\\nFrom the processing point of view, hardware interrupts are similar to resumable exceptions, though they are typically unrelated to the user program\\'s control flow.\\n\\n Exception handling in software \\nSoftware exception handling and the support provided by software tools differs somewhat from what is understood under exception in hardware, but similar concepts are involved. In programming language mechanisms for exception handling, the term \\'\\'exception\\'\\' is typically used in a specific sense to denote a data structure storing information about an exceptional condition. One mechanism to transfer control, or \\'\\'raise\\'\\' an exception, is known as a \\'\\'throw\\'\\'. The exception is said to be \\'\\'thrown\\'\\'. Execution is transferred to a \"catch\".\\n\\nFrom the point of view of the author of a Subroutine|routine, raising an exception is a useful way to signal that a routine could not execute normally - for example, when an input argument is invalid (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function) or when a resource it relies on is unavailable (like a missing file, a hard disk error, or out-of-memory errors). In systems without exceptions, routines would need to return some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated by the semipredicate problem, in which users of the routine need to write extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones.\\n\\nProgramming languages differ substantially in their notion of what is an exception. Contemporary languages can roughly be divided in two groups:<ref name=\"Kiniry\">{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/11818502_16| chapter = Exceptions in Java and Eiffel: Two Extremes in Exception Design and Application| title = Advanced Topics in Exception Handling Techniques| volume = 4119| pages = 288| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2006| last1 = Kiniry | first1 = J.

Particularly in modern enterprise level applications, exceptions must often cross process boundaries and machine boundaries. Part of designing a solid exception handling strategy is recognizing when a process has failed to the point where it cannot be economically handled by the software portion of the process.All Exceptions Are Handled, Jim Wilcox, http://granitestatehacker.kataire.com/2008/02/all-exceptions-are-handled.html\\n\\nException handling is often not handled correctly in software, especially when there are multiple sources of exceptions; data flow analysis of 5 million lines of Java code found over 1300 exception handling defects.<ref name=\"toplas2008\">{{cite news|author1=Weimer, W  |author2=Necula, G.C.|title=Exceptional Situations and Program Reliability|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, vol 30 (2)|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/p/weimer-toplas2008.pdf|year=2008}}\\n\\n= History =\\nSoftware exception handling developed in Lisp (programming language)|Lisp in the 1960s and 1970s. This originated in LISP 1.5 (1962), where exceptions were \\'\\'caught\\'\\' by the <code>ERRSET</code> keyword, which returned <code>NIL</code> in case of an error, instead of terminating the program or entering the debugger.{{sfn|Gabriel|Steele|2008|p=3}} Error \\'\\'raising\\'\\' was introduced in MacLisp in the late 1960s via the <code>ERR</code> keyword.{{sfn|Gabriel|Steele|2008|p=3}} This was rapidly used not only for error raising, but for non-local control flow, and thus was augmented by two new keywords, <code>CATCH</code> and <code>THROW</code> (MacLisp June 1972), reserving <code>ERRSET</code> and <code>ERR</code> for error handling. The cleanup behavior now generally called \"finally\" was introduced in NIL (programming language)|NIL (New Implementation of LISP) in the mid- to late-1970s as <code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code>.{{sfn|White|1979|p=194}} This was then adopted by Common Lisp. Contemporary with this was <code>dynamic-wind</code> in Scheme, which handled exceptions in closures. The first papers on structured exception handling were {{harvtxt|Goodenough|1975a}} and {{harvtxt|Goodenough|1975b}}.{{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|p=392}} Exception handling was subsequently widely adopted by many programming languages from the 1980s onward.\\n\\nOriginally, software exception handling included both resumable exceptions (resumption semantics), like most hardware exceptions, and non-resumable exceptions (termination semantics). However, resumption semantics were considered ineffective in practice in the 1970s and 1980s (see C++ standardization discussion, quoted below){{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|loc=16.6 Exception Handling: Resumption vs. Termination, pp. 390–393}} and are no longer in common use, though provided by programming languages like Common Lisp and Dylan.\\n\\n= Termination semantics =\\nException handling mechanisms in contemporary languages are typically non-resumable (\"termination semantics\") as opposed to hardware exceptions, which are typically resumable. This is based on experience of using both, as there are theoretical and design arguments in favor of either decision; these were extensively debated during C++ standardization discussions 1989–1991, which resulted in a definitive decision for termination semantics.{{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|loc=16.6 Exception Handling: Resumption vs. Termination, pp. 390–393}} On the rationale for such a design for the C++ mechanism, Bjarne Stroustrup|Stroustrup notes:\\n{{blockquote|[A]t the Palo Alto [C++ standardization] meeting in November 1991, we heard a brilliant summary of the arguments for termination semantics backed with both personal experience and data from James G. Mitchell|Jim Mitchell (from Sun, formerly from Xerox PARC). Jim had used exception handling in half a dozen languages over a period of 20 years and was an early proponent of resumption semantics as one of the main designers and implementers of Xerox\\'s Mesa/Cedar|Cedar/Mesa system. His message was\\n:“termination is preferred over resumption; this is not a matter of opinion but a matter of years of experience. Resumption is seductive, but not valid.”\\nHe backed this statement with experience from several operating systems. The key example was Cedar/Mesa: It was written by people who liked and used resumption, but after ten years of use, there was only one use of resumption left in the half million line system – and that was a context inquiry. Because resumption wasn\\'t actually necessary for such a context inquiry, they removed it and found a significant speed increase in that part of the system. In each and every case where resumption had been used it had – over the ten years – become a problem and a more appropriate design had replaced it. Basically, every use of resumption had represented a failure to keep separate levels of abstraction disjoint.{{sfn|Stroustrup|1994|p=392}}}}\\n\\n= Criticism =\\nA contrasting view on the safety of exception handling was given by Tony Hoare|C.A.R Hoare in 1980, describing the Ada (programming language)|Ada programming language as having \"...a plethora of features and notational conventions, many of them unnecessary and some of them, like exception handling, even dangerous. [...] Do not allow this language in its present state to be used in applications where reliability is critical[...].

Hoare. \"The Emperor\\'s Old Clothes\". 1980 Turing Award Lecture\\n\\nCiting multiple prior studies by others (1999–2004) and their own results, Weimer and Necula wrote that a significant problem with exceptions is that they \"create hidden control-flow paths that are difficult for programmers to reason about\".<ref name=\"toplas2008\"/>{{rp|8:27}}\\n\\nGo (programming language)|Go was initially released with exception handling explicitly omitted, with the developers arguing that it obfuscated control flow.{{cite web |url=https://golang.org/doc/faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2017-04-27 |quote=We believe that coupling exceptions to a control structure, as in the try-catch-finally idiom, results in convoluted code.

This problem ended up being solved by RAII, but while RAII solves it, the fact that it is needed is still a source of criticism.\\n\\n= Exception support in programming languages =<!-- This section is linked from Throwing -->\\n{{See also|Exception handling syntax}}\\nMany computer languages have built-in support for exceptions and exception handling. This includes ActionScript, Ada programming language|Ada, BlitzMax, C++, C Sharp (programming language)|C#, COBOL, D programming language|D, ECMAScript, Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel, Java (programming language)|Java, ML programming language|ML, Object Pascal (e.g. Delphi programming language|Delphi, Free Pascal, and the like), PowerBuilder, Objective-C, OCaml, PHP (as of version 5), PL/1, PL/SQL, Prolog, Python (programming language)|Python, REALbasic, Ruby (programming language)|Ruby, Scala (programming language)|Scala, Seed7, Tcl, Visual Prolog and most .NET Framework|.NET languages. Exception handling is commonly not resumable in those languages, and when an exception is thrown, the program searches back through the call stack|stack of function calls until an exception handler is found.\\n\\nSome languages call for stack unwinding|unwinding the stack as this search progresses. That is, if function {{mono|f}}, containing a handler  {{mono|H}} for exception {{mono|E}}, calls function {{mono|g}}, which in turn calls function {{mono|h}}, and an exception {{mono|E}} occurs in {{mono|h}}, then functions {{mono|h}} and {{mono|g}} may be terminated, and {{mono|H}} in {{mono|f}} will handle {{mono|E}}.\\n\\nAn exception-handling language without this unwinding is Common Lisp with its Exception handling#Condition systems|Condition System. Common Lisp calls the exception handler and does not unwind the stack. This allows the program to continue the computation at exactly the same place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available). The stackless implementation of the \\'\\'Mythryl\\'\\' programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding.\\n\\nExcluding minor syntactic differences, there are only a couple of exception handling styles in use. In the most popular style, an exception is initiated by a special statement (<code>throw</code> or <code>raise</code>) with an exception object (e.g. with Java or Object Pascal) or a value of a special extendable enumerated type (e.g. with Ada). The scope for exception handlers starts with a marker clause (<code>try</code> or the language\\'s block starter such as <code>begin</code>) and ends in the start of the first handler clause (<code>catch</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>rescue</code>). Several handler clauses can follow, and each can specify which exception types it handles and what name it uses for the exception object.\\n\\nA few languages also permit a clause (<code>else</code>) that is used in case no exception occurred before the end of the handler\\'s scope was reached.\\n\\nMore common is a related clause (<code>finally</code> or <code>ensure</code>) that is executed whether an exception occurred or not, typically to release resources acquired within the body of the exception-handling block. Notably, C++ does not provide this construct, since it encourages the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) technique which frees resources using destructor (computer programming)|destructors.\\n\\nIn its whole, exception handling code might look like this (in Java (programming language)|Java-like pseudocode; note that an exception type called <code>EmptyLineException</code> would need to be declared somewhere):\\n\\n<source lang=CSharp>\\ntry {\\n    line = console.readLine();\\n\\n    if (line.length()  0) {\\n        throw new EmptyLineException(\"The line read from console was empty!\");\\n    }\\n\\n    console.printLine(\"Hello %s!\" % line);\\n    console.printLine(\"The program ran successfully\");\\n}\\ncatch (EmptyLineException e) {\\n    console.printLine(\"Hello!\");\\n}\\ncatch (Exception e) {\\n    console.printLine(\"Error: \" + e.message());\\n}\\nfinally {\\n    console.printLine(\"The program terminates now\");\\n}\\n</source>\\n\\nAs a minor variation, some languages use a single handler clause, which deals with the class of the exception internally.\\n\\nAccording to a 2008 paper by Westley Wiemer and George Necula, the syntax of the <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code> blocks in Java is a contributing factor to software defects. When a method needs to handle the acquisition and release of 3–5 resources, programmers are apparently unwilling to nest enough blocks due to readability concerns, even when this would be a correct solution. It is possible to use a single <code>try</code>...<code>finally</code> block even when dealing with multiple resources, but that requires a correct use of sentinel values, which is another common source of bugs for this type of problem.<ref name=\"toplas2008\"/>{{rp|8:6–8:7}} Regarding the semantics of the <code>try</code>...<code>catch</code>...<code>finally</code> construct in general, Wiemer and Necula write that \"While try-catch-finally is conceptually simple, it has the most complicated execution description in the language specification [Gosling et al. 1996] and requires four levels of nested “if”s in its official English description. In short, it contains a large number of corner cases that programmers often overlook.\"<ref name=\"toplas2008\"/>{{rp|8:13–8:14}}\\n\\nC supports various means of error checking, but generally is not considered to support \"exception handling,\" although Setjmp.h|the <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code> standard library functions can be used to implement exception semantics.\\n\\nPerl has optional support for structured exception handling.\\n\\nPython (programming language)|Python\\'s support for exception handling is pervasive and consistent. It\\'s difficult to write a robust Python program without using its {{Python|try}} and {{Python|except}} keywords.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\\n\\n= Exception handling implementation =\\n\\nThe implementation of exception handling in programming languages typically involves a fair amount of support from both a code generator and the runtime system accompanying a compiler. (It was the addition of exception handling to C++ that ended the useful lifetime of the original C++ compiler, Cfront.Scott Meyers, [http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_software.html The Most Important C++ Software...Ever], 2006)  Two schemes are most common. The first, \\'\\'dynamic registration\\'\\', generates code that continually updates structures about the program state in terms of exception handling.D. Cameron, P. Faust, D. Lenkov, M. Mehta, \"A portable implementation of C++ exception handling\", \\'\\'Proceedings of the C++ Conference\\'\\' (August 1992) USENIX.  Typically, this adds a new element to the Call stack|stack frame layout that knows what handlers are available for the function or method associated with that frame; if an exception is thrown, a pointer in the layout directs the runtime to the appropriate handler code. This approach is compact in terms of space, but adds execution overhead on frame entry and exit. It was commonly used in many Ada implementations, for example, where complex generation and runtime support was already needed for many other language features. Dynamic registration, being fairly straightforward to define, is amenable to proof of correctness.Graham Hutton, Joel Wright, \"[http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/exceptions.pdf Compiling Exceptions Correctly]\". \\'\\'Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction\\'\\', 2004.\\n\\nThe second scheme, and the one implemented in many production-quality C++ compilers, is a \\'\\'table-driven\\'\\' approach. This creates static tables at compile time and link time that relate ranges of the program counter to the program state with respect to exception handling.{{cite journal | title=Exception handling – Supporting the runtime mechanism | last=Lajoie | first= Josée | journal=C++ Report | volume=6 | issue=3 | date=March–April 1994}}  Then, if an exception is thrown, the runtime system looks up the current instruction location in the tables and determines what handlers are in play and what needs to be done. This approach minimizes executive overhead for the case where an exception is not thrown. This happens at the cost of some space, but this space can be allocated into read-only, special-purpose data sections that are not loaded or relocated until an exception is actually thrown.<ref name=cppeh>{{cite journal | title=Optimizing away C++ exception handling | last=Schilling | first=Jonathan L. | journal=SIGPLAN Notices | volume=33 | issue=8 | date=August 1998 | pages=40–47 | doi=10.1145/286385.286390}}  This second approach is also superior in terms of achieving thread safety{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}.\\n\\nOther definitional and implementation schemes have been proposed as well.\"[http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/how-to-implement-software-exception-handling/]\", Intel Corporation. For languages that support metaprogramming, approaches that involve no overhead at all have been advanced.M. Hof, H. Mössenböck, P.

The idea is to provide a more rigorous basis for exception handling by defining precisely what is \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" behavior. Specifically, the approach is based on two concepts:\\n\\n \\'\\'\\'Failure\\'\\'\\': the inability of an operation to fulfill its contract. For example, an addition may produce an arithmetic overflow (it does not fulfill its contract of computing a good approximation to the mathematical sum); or a routine may fail to meet its postcondition.\\n \\'\\'\\'Exception\\'\\'\\': an abnormal event occurring during the execution of a routine (that routine is the \"\\'\\'recipient\\'\\'\" of the exception) during its execution. Such an abnormal event results from the \\'\\'failure\\'\\' of an operation called by the routine.\\n\\nThe \"Safe Exception Handling principle\" as introduced by Bertrand Meyer in Object-Oriented Software Construction then holds that there are only two meaningful ways a routine can react when an exception occurs:\\n\\n Failure, or \"organized panic\": The routine fixes the object\\'s state by re-establishing the invariant (this is the \"organized\" part), and then fails (panics), triggering an exception in its caller (so that the abnormal event is not ignored).\\n Retry: The routine tries the algorithm again, usually after changing some values so that the next attempt will have a better chance to succeed.\\n\\nIn particular, simply ignoring an exception is not permitted; a block must either be retried and successfully complete, or propagate the exception to its caller.\\n\\nHere is an example expressed in Eiffel syntax. It assumes that a routine {{Eiffel|send_fast}} is normally the better way to send a message, but it may fail, triggering an exception; if so, the algorithm next uses {{Eiffel|send_slow}}, which will fail less often. If {{Eiffel|send_slow}} fails, the routine {{Eiffel|send}} as a whole should fail, causing the caller to get an exception.\\n\\n<source lang=Eiffel>\\nsend (m: MESSAGE) is\\n  -- Send m through fast link, if possible, otherwise through slow link.\\nlocal\\n  tried_fast, tried_slow: BOOLEAN\\ndo\\n  if tried_fast then\\n     tried_slow := True\\n     send_slow (m)\\n  else\\n     tried_fast := True\\n     send_fast (m)\\n  end\\nrescue\\n  if not tried_slow then\\n     retry\\n  end\\nend\\n</source>\\n\\nThe boolean local variables are initialized to False at the start. If  {{Eiffel|send_fast}} fails, the body ({{Eiffel|do}} clause) will be executed again, causing execution of {{Eiffel|send_slow}}. If this execution of {{Eiffel|send_slow}} fails, the {{Eiffel|rescue}} clause will execute to the end with no {{Eiffel|retry}} (no {{Eiffel|else}} clause in the final {{Eiffel|if}}), causing the routine execution as a whole to fail.\\n\\nThis approach has the merit of defining clearly what \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" cases are: an abnormal case, causing an exception, is one in which the routine is unable to fulfill its contract. It defines a clear distribution of roles: the {{Eiffel|do}} clause (normal body) is in charge of achieving, or attempting to achieve, the routine\\'s contract; the {{Eiffel|rescue}} clause is in charge of reestablishing the context and restarting the process, if this has a chance of succeeding, but not of performing any actual computation.\\n\\nAlthough exceptions in Eiffel have a fairly clear philosophy, Kiniry (2006) criticizes their implementation because \"Exceptions that are part of the language definition are represented by INTEGER values, developer-defined exceptions by STRING values. [...] Additionally, because they are basic values and not objects, they have no inherent semantics beyond that which is expressed in a helper routine which necessarily cannot be foolproof because of the representation overloading in effect (e.g., one cannot\\ndifferentiate two integers of the same value).\"<ref name=\"Kiniry\"/>\\n\\n= Uncaught exceptions =\\nIf an exception is thrown and not caught (operationally, an exception is thrown when there is no applicable handler specified), the uncaught exception is handled by the runtime; the routine that does this is called the \\'\\'\\'{{visible anchor|uncaught exception handler}}\\'\\'\\'.<ref name=\"cocoa\">\\'\\'Mac Developer Library\\'\\', \"[https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Exceptions/Concepts/UncaughtExceptions.html Uncaught Exceptions]\"\\'\\'MSDN\\'\\', [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.unhandledexception(v=vs.110).aspx AppDomain.UnhandledException Event] The most common default behavior is to terminate the program and print an error message to the console, usually including debug information such as a string representation of the exception and the stack trace.<ref name=\"cocoa\"/>\\'\\'The Python Tutorial\\'\\', \"[https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html 8.

This is particularly important for servers, where for example a servlet (running in its own thread) can be terminated without the server overall being affected.\\n\\nThis default uncaught exception handler may be overridden, either globally or per-thread, for example to provide alternative logging or end-user reporting of uncaught exceptions, or to restart threads that terminate due to an uncaught exception. For example, in Java this is done for a single thread via <code>[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#setUncaughtExceptionHandler-java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler- Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler]</code> and globally via <code>[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler- Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler]</code>; in Python this is done by modifying <code>[https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook sys.excepthook]</code>.\\n\\n= Static checking of exceptions =\\n\\n Checked exceptions \\n\\nThe designers of Java devised[http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9901&L=rmi-users&F=P&P=36083 Re: Toward a more \"automatic\" RMI = compatible with basic RMI philosophy], Ann Wollrath (JavaSoft East).

A function could raise only exceptions listed in its type, but any leaking exceptions from called functions would automatically be turned into the sole runtime exception, {{code|failure}}, instead of resulting in compile-time error. Later, Modula-3 had a similar feature.{{cite web|url=http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/graphics/modula3/tutorial/www/m3_23.html#SEC23 |title=Modula-3 - Procedure Types |publisher=.cs.columbia.edu |date=1995-03-08 |accessdate=2011-12-15}} These features don\\'t include the compile time checking that is central in the concept of checked exceptions, and hasn\\'t (as of 2006) been incorporated into major programming languages other than Java.{{cite web|url=http://www.mindview.net/Etc/Discussions/CheckedExceptions |title=Bruce Eckel\\'s MindView, Inc: Does Java need Checked Exceptions? |publisher=Mindview.net |accessdate=2011-12-15}}\\n\\nThe C++ programming language introduces an optional mechanism for checked exceptions, called \\'\\'exception specifications\\'\\'. By default any function can throw any exception, but this can be limited by a {{Cpp|throw}} clause added to the function signature, that specifies which exceptions the function may throw. Exception specifications are not enforced at compile-time. Violations result in the global function {{Cpp|std::unexpected}} being called.<ref name=bjarne-exc>Bjarne Stroustrup, \\'\\'The C++ Programming Language\\'\\' Third Edition, Addison Wesley, 1997. ISBN 0-201-88954-4. pp. 375-380.  An empty exception specification may be given, which indicates that the function will throw no exception. This was not made the default when exception handling was added to the language because it would require too much modification of existing code, would impede interaction with code written in another language, and would tempt programmers into writing too many handlers at the local level.<ref name=bjarne-exc/> Explicit use of empty exception specifications can, however, allow C++ compilers to perform significant code and stack layout optimizations that generally have to be suppressed when exception handling may take place in a function.<ref name=cppeh />  Some analysts view the proper use of exception specifications in C++ as difficult to achieve.{{cite journal | title=Ten Guidelines for Exception Specifications | last=Reeves | first= J.W. | journal=C++ Report | volume=8 | issue=7 |date=July 1996}} In the {{as of|2012|alt=recent|url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/}} C++ language standard (C++11), the use of exception specifications as specified in the preceding version of the standard (C++03) is Deprecation|deprecated.{{cite web|url=http://herbsutter.com/2010/03/13/trip-report-march-2010-iso-c-standards-meeting/ |title=Trip Report: March 2010 ISO C++ Standards Meeting |last=Sutter |first=Herb |authorlink=Herb Sutter |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}\\n\\nIn contrast to Java, languages like C# do not enforce that exceptions have to be caught. According to Hanspeter Mössenböck, not distinguishing between to-be-called (checked) exceptions and not-to-be-called (unchecked) exceptions makes the written program more convenient, but less robust, as an uncaught exception results in an abort with a stack trace.{{cite web\\n| accessdate = 2011-08-05\\n| date       = 2002-03-25\\n| first      = Hanspeter\\n| last       = Mössenböck\\n| location   = http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/\\n| page       = 32\\n| publisher  = Institut für Systemsoftware, Johannes Kepler Universität Linz, Fachbereich Informatik\\n| title      = Advanced C#: Variable Number of Parameters\\n| url        = http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/Part2.pdf}}\\n Kiniry (2006) notes however that Java\\'s JDK (version 1.4.1) throws a large number of unchecked exceptions: one for every 140 lines of code, whereas Eiffel uses them much more sparingly, with one thrown every 4,600 lines of code. Kiniry also writes that \"As any Java programmer knows, the volume of <code>try catch</code> code in a typical Java application is sometimes larger than the comparable code necessary for explicit formal parameter and return value checking in other languages that do not have checked exceptions. In fact, the general consensus among in-the-trenches Java programmers is that dealing with checked exceptions is nearly as unpleasant a task as writing documentation. Thus, many programmers report that they “resent” checked exceptions. This leads to an abundance of checked-but-ignored exceptions\".<ref name=\"Kiniry\"/> Kiniry also notes that the developers of C# apparently were influenced by this kind of user experiences, with the following quote being attributed to them (via Eric Gunnerson): {{quote|\"Examination of small programs leads to the conclusion that requiring exception specifications could both enhance developer productivity and enhance code quality, but experience with large software projects suggests a different result – decreased productivity and little or no increase in code quality.\"<ref name=\"Kiniry\"/>}} According to Anders Hejlsberg there was fairly broad agreement in their design group to not have checked exceptions as a language feature in C#. Hejlsberg explained in an interview that {{quote|“The throws clause, at least the way it\\'s implemented in Java, doesn\\'t necessarily force you to handle the exceptions, but if you don\\'t handle them, it forces you to acknowledge precisely which exceptions might pass through. It requires you to either catch declared exceptions or put them in your own throws clause. To work around this requirement, people do ridiculous things. For example, they decorate every method with, \"throws Exception.\" That just completely defeats the feature, and you just made the programmer write more gobbledy gunk. That doesn\\'t help anybody.”{{cite web |url=http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs.html |title=The Trouble with Checked Exceptions: A Conversation with Anders Hejlsberg, Part II |author1=Bill Venners |author2=Bruce Eckel | date=August 18, 2003 | page=[http://www.artima.com/intv/handcuffs2.html 2]}}}}\\n\\n Views on usage \\n{{essay|section|date=July 2014}}\\nChecked exceptions can, at compile time, reduce the incidence of unhandled exceptions surfacing at Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime in a given application. Unchecked exceptions (such as the Java (programming language)|Java objects {{Java|RuntimeException}} and {{Java|Error}}) remain unhandled.\\n\\nHowever, checked exceptions can either require extensive {{Java|throws}} declarations, revealing implementation details and reducing encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulation, or encourage coding poorly considered {{Java|try/catch}} blocks that can hide legitimate exceptions from their appropriate handlers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Consider a growing codebase over time. An interface may be declared to throw exceptions X and Y. In a later version of the code, if one wants to throw exception Z, it would make the new code incompatible with the earlier uses. Furthermore, with the adapter pattern, in which one body of code declares an interface that is then implemented by a different body of code so that code can be plugged in and called by the first, the adapter code may have a rich set of exceptions to describe problems, but is forced to use the exception types declared in the interface.\\n\\nIt is possible to reduce the number of declared exceptions either by declaring a superclass (computer science)|superclass of all potentially thrown exceptions, or by defining and declaring exception types that are suitable for the level of abstraction of the called methodBloch 2001:178 {{cite book | last = Bloch | first = Joshua | year = 2001 | title = Effective Java Programming Language Guide | publisher = Addison-Wesley Professional | isbn = 0-201-31005-8 }} and mapping lower level exceptions to these types, preferably wrapped using exception chaining in order to preserve the root cause. In addition, it\\'s very possible that in the example above of the changing interface that the calling code would need to be modified as well, since in some sense the exceptions a method may throw are part of the method\\'s implicit interface anyway.\\n\\nUsing a {{C++|throws Exception}} declaration or {{C++|catch (Exception e)}} is usually sufficient for satisfying the checking in Java. While this may have some use, it essentially circumvents the checked exception mechanism, which Oracle discourages.{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/advantages.html |title=Advantages of Exceptions (The Java™ Tutorials : Essential Classes : Exceptions) |publisher=Download.oracle.com |accessdate=2011-12-15}}\\n\\nUnchecked exception types should generally not be handled, except possibly at the outermost levels of scope. These often represent scenarios that do not allow for recovery: {{C++|RuntimeException}}s frequently reflect programming defects,Bloch 2001:172 and {{C++|Error}}s generally represent unrecoverable JVM failures. Even in a language that supports checked exceptions, there are cases where the use of checked exceptions is not appropriate.{{cite web|url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/runtime.html |title=Unchecked Exceptions \\x97 The Controversy (The Java™ Tutorials : Essential Classes : Exceptions) |publisher=Download.oracle.com |accessdate=2011-12-15}}\\n\\n= Dynamic checking of exceptions =\\n\\nThe point of exception handling routines is to ensure that the code can handle error conditions. In order to establish that exception handling routines are sufficiently robust, it is necessary to present the code with a wide spectrum of invalid or unexpected inputs, such as can be created via software fault injection and mutation testing (that is also sometimes referred to as fuzz testing). One of the most difficult types of software for which to write exception handling routines is protocol software, since a robust protocol implementation must be prepared to receive input that does not comply with the relevant specification(s).\\n\\nIn order to ensure that meaningful regression analysis can be conducted throughout a Software development process|software development lifecycle process, any exception handling testing should be highly automated, and the test cases must be generated in a scientific, repeatable fashion. Several commercially available systems exist that perform such testing.\\n\\nIn runtime engine environments such as Java (programming language)|Java or .NET Framework|.NET, there exist tools that attach to the runtime engine and every time that an exception of interest occurs, they record debugging information that existed in memory at the time the exception was thrown (call stack and heap (data structure)|heap values). These tools are called automated exception handling or error interception tools and provide \\'root-cause\\' information for exceptions.\\n\\n= Exception synchronicity =\\n\\nSomewhat related with the concept of checked exceptions is \\'\\'exception synchronicity\\'\\'. Synchronous exceptions happen at a specific program statement whereas \\'\\'\\'asynchronous exceptions\\'\\'\\' can raise practically anywhere.{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/415348.html |title=Asynchronous Exceptions in Haskell - Marlow, Jones, Moran (ResearchIndex) |publisher=Citeseer.ist.psu.edu |accessdate=2011-12-15}}Safe asynchronous exceptions for Python. http://www.cs.williams.edu/~freund/papers/02-lwl2.ps It follows that asynchronous exception handling can\\'t be required by the compiler. They are also difficult to program with. Examples of naturally asynchronous events include pressing Control-C|Ctrl-C to interrupt a program, and receiving a Signal (computing)|signal such as \"stop\" or \"suspend\" from another Thread (computer science)|thread of execution.\\n\\nProgramming languages typically deal with this by limiting asynchronicity, for example Java has deprecated the use of its ThreadDeath exception that was used to allow one thread to stop another one.{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/misc/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html |title=Java Thread Primitive Deprecation |publisher=Java.sun.com |accessdate=2011-12-15}} Instead, there can be semi-asynchronous exceptions that only raise in suitable locations of the program or synchronously.\\n\\n= Condition systems =\\nCommon Lisp, Dylan programming language|Dylan and Smalltalk have a condition system{{cite web|author = What Conditions (Exceptions) are Really About|url = http://danweinreb.org/blog/what-conditions-exceptions-are-really-about|title = What Conditions (Exceptions) are Really About|publisher = Danweinreb.org|date = 2008-03-24|accessdate = 2014-09-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130201124021/http://danweinreb.org/blog/what-conditions-exceptions-are-really-about|archivedate = February 1, 2013}} (see Common Lisp#Condition system|Common Lisp Condition System) that encompasses the aforementioned exception handling systems. In those languages or environments the advent of a condition (a \"generalisation of an error\" according to Kent Pitman) implies a function call, and only late in the exception handler the decision to unwind the stack may be taken.\\n\\nConditions are a generalization of exceptions. When a condition arises, an appropriate condition handler is searched for  and selected, in stack order, to handle the condition. Conditions that do not represent errors may safely go unhandled entirely; their only purpose may be to propagate hints or warnings toward the user.{{cite web|url=http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/6.2/ansicl/section/conditio.htm |title=Condition System Concepts |publisher=Franz.com |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2011-12-15}}\\n\\n Continuable exceptions \\nThis is related to the so-called \\'\\'resumption model\\'\\' of exception handling, in which some exceptions are said to be \\'\\'continuable\\'\\': it is permitted to return to the expression that signaled an exception, after having taken corrective action in the handler. The condition system is generalized thus: within the handler of a non-serious condition (a.k.a. \\'\\'continuable exception\\'\\'), it is possible to jump to predefined restart points (a.k.a. \\'\\'restarts\\'\\') that lie between the signaling expression and the condition handler. Restarts are functions closed over some lexical environment, allowing the programmer to repair this environment before exiting the condition handler completely or unwinding the stack even partially.\\n\\n Restarts separate mechanism from policy \\nCondition handling moreover provides a separation of mechanism from policy. Restarts provide various possible mechanisms for recovering from error, but do not select which mechanism is appropriate in a given situation. That is the province of the condition handler, which (since it is located in higher-level code) has access to a broader view.\\n\\nAn example: Suppose there is a library function whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, the right thing to do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it—but in an automated log-summarizing program, the right thing to do might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed.\\n\\nThat is to say, the question can only be answered in terms of the broader goals of the program, which are not known to the general-purpose library function. Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the right answer. So instead of simply exiting with an error, the function may \\'\\'establish restarts\\'\\' offering various ways to continue—for instance, to skip the log entry, to supply default or null values for the unreadable fields, to ask the user for the missing values, \\'\\'or\\'\\' to unwind the stack and abort processing with an error message. The restarts offered constitute the \\'\\'mechanisms\\'\\' available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the \\'\\'policy\\'\\'.\\n\\nSee also\\n Exception handling syntax\\n Automated exception handling\\n Exception safety\\n Continuation\\n Defensive programming\\n setjmp/longjmp\\n Triple fault\\n Vectored Exception Handling (VEH)\\n Option types and Result types, alternative ways of handling errors in functional programming without exceptions\\n\\nReferences\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n{{refbegin}}\\n {{Cite conference| doi = 10.1145/1529966.1529967| title = A Pattern of Language Evolution| conference = LISP50: Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Lisp| pages = 1–10| year = 2008| last1 = Gabriel | first1 = Richard P.| authorlink1 = Richard P.

Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It’s much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL, a computer language for data processors. I could say “Subtract income tax from pay” instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols.

In comparison to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable relative to a lower-level language.

(1997). \"Konrad Zuse\\'s Plankalkül: The First High-Level \"non von Neumann\" Programming Language\". IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol. 19, no. 2, pp.&nbsp;17–24,  April–June, 1997. [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/85.586068 (abstract)] However, it was not implemented in his time, and his original contributions were (due to World War II) largely isolated from other developments, although it influenced Heinz Rutishauser\\'s language \"Superplan\" (and to some degree also Algol). The first really widespread high-level language was Fortran, a machine independent development of IBM\\'s earlier Autocode systems. ALGOL|Algol, defined in 1958 and 1960, by committees of European and American computer scientists, introduced recursion as well as nested functions under lexical scope. It was also the first language with a clear distinction between call by value|value and call by name|name-parameters and their corresponding semantics.Although it lacked a notion of call by reference|reference-parameters, which could be a problem in some situations. Several successors, including AlgolW, Algol68, Simula, Pascal (programming language)|Pascal, Modula and Ada (programming language)|Ada therefore included reference-parameters (The related C-language family instead allowed addresses as \\'\\'\\'value\\'\\'\\'-parameters). Algol also introduced several structured programming concepts, such as the \\'\\'\\'while-do\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'if-then-else\\'\\'\\' constructs and its syntax was the first to be described by a formal method, Backus–Naur form (BNF). During roughly the same period Cobol introduced record (computer science)|records (also called structs) and Lisp (programming language)|Lisp introduced a fully general lambda abstraction in a programming language for the first time.\\n\\n== Features ==\\n\"High-level language\" refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, object (computer science)|objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, Thread (computer science)|threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. Unlike low-level assembly languages, high-level languages have few, if any, language elements that translate directly into a machine\\'s native opcodes. Other features, such as string handling routines, object-oriented language features, and file input/output, may also be present.\\n\\n== Abstraction penalty ==\\nHigh-level languages intend to provide features which standardize common tasks, permit rich debugging, and maintain architectural agnosticism; while low-level languages often produce more efficient code through optimization for a specific system architecture. \\'\\'Abstraction penalty\\'\\' is the border that prevents high-level programming techniques from being applied in situations where computational limitations, standards conformance or physical constraints require access to low-level architectural resources (fi, response time(s), hardware integration). High-level programming exhibits features like more generic data structures/operations, run-time interpretation, and intermediate code files; which often result in execution of far more operations than necessary, higher memory consumption, and larger binary program size.{{cite journal\\n |author=Surana P \\n |title=Meta-Compilation of Language Abstractions. \\n |year=2006 \\n |url=ftp://lispnyc.org/meeting-assets/2007-02-13_pinku/SuranaThesis.pdf \\n |format=PDF \\n |accessdate=2008-03-17 \\n |deadurl=yes \\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217154926/http://lispnyc.org/meeting-assets/2007-02-13_pinku/SuranaThesis.pdf \\n |archivedate=2015-02-17 \\n |df= \\n}}{{cite web\\n  | last = Kuketayev\\n  | title = The Data Abstraction Penalty (DAP) Benchmark for Small Objects in Java.\\n  | url= http://www.adtmag.com/joop/article.aspx?id=4597\\n  | accessdate = 2008-03-17 }}{{Cite book\\n  | last = Chatzigeorgiou\\n  | last2 = Stephanides\\n  | editor-last = Blieberger\\n  | editor2-last = Strohmeier\\n  | contribution = Evaluating Performance and Power Of Object-Oriented Vs.

In many cases, critical portions of a program mostly in a high-level language can be hand-coded in assembly language, leading to a much faster, more efficient, or simply reliably functioning Program optimisation|optimised program.\\n\\nHowever, with the growing complexity of modern microprocessor architectures, well-designed compilers for high-level languages frequently produce code comparable in efficiency to what most low-level programmers can produce by hand, and the higher abstraction may allow for more powerful techniques providing better overall results than their low-level counterparts in particular settings.\\n{{Cite journal\\n  |author1=Manuel Carro |author2=José F.

This facilitates executing a program written in such a language on any computing system with compatible support for the Interpreted or Just-in-time compilation|JIT program. High-level languages can be improved as their designers develop improvements. In other cases, new high-level languages evolve from one or more others with the goal of aggregating the most popular constructs with new or improved features. An example of this is Scala (programming language)|Scala which maintains backward compatibility with Java (programming language)|Java which means that programs and libraries written in Java will continue to be usable even if a programming shop switches to Scala; this makes the transition easier and the lifespan of such high-level coding indefinite. In contrast, low-level programs rarely survive beyond the system architecture which they were written for without major revision. This is the engineering \\'trade-off\\' for the \\'Abstraction Penalty\\'.\\n\\n== Relative meaning ==\\nExamples of high-level programming languages in active use today include Python (programming language)|Python, Visual Basic, Delphi (programming language)|Delphi, Perl, PHP, ECMAScript, Ruby (programming language)|Ruby and many others.\\n\\nThe terms \\'\\'high-level\\'\\' and \\'\\'low-level\\'\\' are inherently relative. Some decades ago, the C (programming language)|C language, and similar languages, were most often considered \"high-level\", as it supported concepts such as expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered \"low-level\".  Today, many programmers might refer to C as low-level, as it lacks a large Run time system|runtime-system (no garbage collection, etc.), basically supports only scalar operations, and provides direct memory addressing. It, therefore, readily blends with assembly language and the machine level of CPUs and microcontrollers.\\n\\nAssembly language may itself be regarded as a higher level (but often still one-to-one if used without Macro (computer science)|macros) representation of machine code, as it supports concepts such as constants and (limited) expressions, sometimes even variables, procedures, and data structures. Machine code, in its turn, is inherently at a slightly higher level than the microcode or micro-operations used internally in many processors.\\n\\n== Execution modes ==\\nThere are three general modes of execution for modern high-level languages:\\n; Interpreted : When code written in a language is interpreted language|interpreted, its syntax is read and then executed directly, with no compilation stage. A program called an \\'\\'interpreter\\'\\' reads each program statement, following the program flow, then decides what to do, and does it. A hybrid of an interpreter and a compiler will compile the statement into machine code and execute that; the machine code is then discarded, to be interpreted anew if the line is executed again. Interpreters are commonly the simplest implementations of the behavior of a language, compared to the other two variants listed here.\\n; Compiled : When code written in a language is Compiled language|compiled, its syntax is transformed into an executable form before running. There are two types of compilation:\\n:; Machine code generation : Some compilers compile source code directly into machine code. This is the original mode of compilation, and languages that are directly and completely transformed to machine-native code in this way may be called \"truly compiled\" languages. See assembly language.\\n:; Intermediate representations : When code written in a language is compiled to an intermediate representation, that representation can be optimized or saved for later execution without the need to re-read the source file. When the intermediate representation is saved, it may be in a form such as byte code. The intermediate representation must then be interpreted or further compiled to execute it. Virtual machines that execute byte code directly or transform it further into machine code have blurred the once clear distinction between intermediate representations and truly compiled languages.\\n; Source-to-Source Translated or Trans-compiled: Code written in a language may be translated into terms of a lower-level programming language for which native code compilers are already widely available. JavaScript and the C (programming language)|C programming language are common targets for such translators. See CoffeeScript, Chicken Scheme, and Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel as examples. Specifically, the generated C and C++ code can be seen (as generated from the Eiffel programming language when using the EiffelStudio IDE) in the EIFGENs directory of any compiled Eiffel project. In Eiffel, the \"Translated\" process is referred to as Trans-compiling or Trans-compiled, and the Eiffel compiler as a Source-to-source compiler|Transcompiler.\\n\\nNote that languages are not strictly \"interpreted\" languages or \"compiled\" languages. Rather, implementations of language behavior use interpretation or compilation. For example, Algol 60 and Fortran have both been interpreted (even though they were more typically compiled). Similarly, Java shows the difficulty of trying to apply these labels to languages, rather than to implementations; Java is compiled to bytecode and the bytecode is subsequently executed by either interpretation (in a Java Virtual Machine|JVM) or compilation (typically with a just-in-time compiler such as HotSpot, again in a JVM). Moreover, compilation, trans-compiling, and interpretation are not strictly limited to just a description of the compiler artifact (binary executable or IL assembly).\\n\\n===High-level language computer architecture===\\n\\nAlternatively, it is possible for a high-level language to be directly implemented by a computer – the computer directly executes the HLL code. This is known as a \\'\\'high-level language computer architecture\\'\\' – the computer architecture itself is designed to be targeted by a specific high-level language.\\n\\n== See also ==\\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\\n Abstraction (computer science)\\n Generational list of programming languages\\n Low-level programming languages\\n High-level assembler\\n Very high-level programming languages\\n Categorical list of programming languages\\n{{Clear}}\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n== External links ==\\n http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HighLevelLanguage - The WikiWikiWeb\\'s article on high-level programming languages\\n\\n{{Programming language}}\\n\\n{{Authority control}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:High-Level Programming Language}}\\nCategory:Programming language classification\\n\\n',\n",

Even without booting, computers can be configured to execute software on some media as soon as they become available, e.g. to autorun a CD or USB device when inserted.\\n\\nMalicious software distributors would trick the user into booting or running from an infected device or medium.

Users may also execute disguised malicious email attachments and infected executable files supplied in other ways.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\\n\\n= Over-privileged users and over-privileged code =\\n{{Main article|principle of least privilege}}\\n\\nIn computing, Privilege (computing)|privilege refers to how much a user or program is allowed to modify a system. In poorly designed computer systems, both users and programs can be assigned more privileges than they should be, and malware can take advantage of this. The two ways that malware does this is through overprivileged users and overprivileged code.\\n\\nSome systems allow all users to modify their internal structures, and such users today would be considered Administrative privileges|over-privileged users. This was the standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems, where there was no distinction between an \\'\\'administrator\\'\\' or \\'\\'root\\'\\', and a regular user of the system. In some systems, system administrator|non-administrator users are over-privileged by design, in the sense that\\nthey are allowed to modify internal structures of the system. In some environments, users are over-privileged because they have been inappropriately granted administrator or equivalent status.\\n\\nSome systems allow code executed by a user to access all rights of that user, which is known as over-privileged code. This was also standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems. Malware, running as over-privileged code, can use this privilege to subvert the system. Almost all currently popular operating systems, and also many script (computing)|scripting applications allow code too many privileges, usually in the sense that when a user\\nExecutable|executes code, the system allows that code all rights of that user. This makes users vulnerable to malware in the form of e-mail attachments, which may or may not be disguised.\\n\\n= Use of the same operating system =\\n Homogeneity can be a vulnerability. For example, when all computers in a Computer network|network run the same operating system, upon exploiting one, one Computer worm|worm can exploit them all:<ref name=\"UKan\">\"LNCS 3786 – Key Factors Influencing Worm Infection\", U. Kanlayasiri, 2006, web (PDF): [http://www.springerlink.com/index/3x8582h43ww06440.pdf SL40-PDF]. In particular, Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X have such a large share of the market that an\\n  exploited vulnerability concentrating on either operating system could subvert a large number of systems. Introducing diversity purely for the sake of robustness, such as adding Linux computers, could increase short-term costs for training and maintenance. However, as long as all the nodes are not part of the same directory service for authentication, having a few diverse nodes could deter total shutdown of the Computer network|network and allow those nodes to help with recovery of\\n  the infected nodes. Such separate, functional redundancy could avoid the cost of a total shutdown, at the cost of increased complexity and reduced usability in terms of single sign-on authentication.\\n\\n   Anti-malware strategies \\n  {{Main article|Antivirus software}}\\n  As malware attacks become more frequent, attention has begun to shift from computer virus|viruses and spyware protection, to malware protection, and programs that have been specifically developed to combat malware. (Other preventive and recovery measures, such as backup and recovery methods, are mentioned in the Computer virus#Antivirus software and other preventive measures|computer virus article).\\n\\n  = Anti-virus and anti-malware software =\\n  A specific component of anti-virus and anti-malware software, commonly referred to as an on-access or real-time scanner, hooks deep into the operating system\\'s core or operating system kernel|kernel and functions in a manner similar to how certain malware itself would attempt to operate, though with the user\\'s informed permission for protecting the system. Any time the operating system accesses a file, the on-access scanner checks if the file is a \\'legitimate\\' file or not. If\\n  the file is identified as malware by the scanner, the access operation will be stopped, the file will be dealt with by the scanner in a pre-defined way (how the anti-virus program was configured during/post installation), and the user will be notified.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This may have a considerable performance impact on the operating system, though the degree of impact is dependent on how well the scanner was programmed. The goal is to stop any operations the\\n  malware may attempt on the system before they occur, including activities which might exploit Software bug|bugs or trigger unexpected operating system behavior.\\n\\n  Anti-malware programs can combat malware in two ways:\\n# They can provide real time protection against the installation of malware software on a computer. This type of malware protection works the same way as that of antivirus protection in that the anti-malware software scans all incoming Computer network|network data for malware and blocks any Threat (computer)|threats it comes across.\\n# Anti-malware software programs can be used solely for detection and removal of malware software that has already been installed onto a computer. This type of anti-malware software scans the contents of the Windows registry, operating system files, and installed programs on a computer and will provide a list of any threats found, allowing the user to choose which files to delete or keep, or to compare this list to a list of known malware components, removing files that match.<ref>{{cite\\n  web|url=https://antivirus.comodo.com/how-antivirus-software-works.php |title=How Antivirus Software Works? |accessdate=2015-10-16}}\\n\\n  Real-time protection from malware works identically to real-time antivirus protection: the software scans disk files at download time, and blocks the activity of components known to represent malware. In some cases, it may also intercept attempts to install start-up items or to modify browser settings. Because many malware components are installed as a result of browser exploits or user error, using security software (some of which are anti-malware, though many are not) to \"sandbox\"\\n  browsers (essentially isolate the browser from the computer and hence any malware induced change) can also be effective in helping to restrict any damage done.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\\n\\n  Examples of Microsoft Windows anti-virus|antivirus and anti-malware software include the optional Microsoft Security Essentials<ref>{{cite web | title=Microsoft Security Essentials | url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials | publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=21 June 2012}} (for Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7) for real-time protection, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool<ref>{{cite web | title=Malicious Software\\n  Removal Tool | url=http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/malware-removal.aspx |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=21 June 2012}} (now included with Windows Update|Windows (Security) Updates on \"Patch Tuesday\", the second Tuesday of each month), and Windows Defender (an optional download in the case of Windows XP, incorporating MSE functionality in the case of Windows 8 and later).<ref>{{cite web | title=Windows Defender |\\n  url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=21 June 2012}} Additionally, several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet (usually restricted to non-commercial use).<ref name=\"PCmag\">{{cite web|last=Rubenking|first=Neil J.|title=The Best Free Antivirus for 2014|publisher=pcmag.com|date=8 January 2014|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388652,00.asp}} Tests found some\\n  free programs to be competitive with commercial ones.<ref name=\"PCmag\" /> Microsoft\\'s System File Checker can be used to check for and repair corrupted system files.\\n\\n  Some viruses disable System Restore and other important Windows tools such as Task Manager and Command Prompt (Windows)|Command Prompt.

Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is backtracking|backtracked and another path is systematically attempted.\\n\\n===Compilation and interpretation===\\nA computer program in the form of a human-readable, computer programming language is called source code. Source code may be converted into an Executable file|executable image by a compiler or execution (computing)|executed immediately with the aid of an Interpreter (computing)|interpreter.\\n\\nCompilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either Object file|object code or machine code.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Compiler?|url=http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/notes/node3.html|accessdate=2012-01-10}}  Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the central processing unit|central processing unit\\'s native instructions, ready for execution. Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as Binary file|binaries&nbsp;– a reference to the Binary numeral system|binary file format used to store the executable code.\\n\\nInterpreters are used to execute source code from a programming language line-by-line. The interpreter Parsing|decodes each Statement (computer science)|statement and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters is that they can easily be extended to an REPL|interactive session. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.\\n\\nThe main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is an interpreter must be present on the executing computer. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.\\n\\njust-in-time compilation|Just in time compilers pre-compile computer programs just before execution. For example, the Java virtual machine#Process virtual machines|virtual machine Hotspot contains a Just In Time Compiler which selectively compiles Java bytecode into machine code - but only code which Hotspot predicts is likely to be used many times.\\n\\nEither compiled or interpreted programs might be executed in a batch processing|batch process without human interaction.\\n\\nScripting languages are often used to create batch processes. One common scripting language is Unix shell, and its executing environment is called the command-line interface.\\n\\nNo properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, Java is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of Java compilers and C interpreters.\\n\\n==Storage and execution==\\nFile:Papertape3.jpg|thumb|In the 1950s, computer programs were stored on Punched tape|perforated paper tape \\n\\nTypically, computer programs are stored in non-volatile memory until requested either directly or indirectly to be execution (computing)|executed by the computer user.

Reverse engineering can be used when a system is required to interface to another system and how both systems would negotiate is to be established. Such requirements typically exist for interoperability.\\n \\'\\'\\'Military or commercial espionage\\'\\'\\'. Learning about an enemy\\'s or competitor\\'s latest research by stealing or capturing a prototype and dismantling it. It may result in development of similar product, or better countermeasures for it.\\n \\'\\'\\'Improve documentation shortcomings\\'\\'\\'. Reverse engineering can be done when documentation of a system for its design, production, operation or maintenance have shortcomings and original designers are not available to improve it. Reverse engineering of software can provide the most current documentation necessary for understanding the most current state of a software system.\\n \\'\\'\\'Obsolescence\\'\\'\\'. Integrated circuits are often designed on proprietary systems, and built on production lines which become obsolete in only a few years.  When systems using these parts can no longer be maintained (since the parts are no longer made), the only way to incorporate the functionality into new technology is to reverse-engineer the existing chip and then Remake (computing)|re-design it using newer tools, using the understanding gained as a guide. Another obsolescence originated problem which can be solved by reverse engineering is the need to support (maintenance and supply for continuous operation) existing, legacy devices which are no longer supported by their original equipment manufacturer (OEM). This problem is particularly critical in military operations.\\n \\'\\'\\'Software modernization\\'\\'\\' - often knowledge is lost over time, which can prevent updates and improvements.  Reverse engineering is generally needed in order to understand the \\'as is\\' state of existing or legacy software in order to properly estimate the effort required to migrate system knowledge into a \\'to be\\' state. Much of this may be driven by changing functional, compliance or security requirements.\\n \\'\\'\\'Product security analysis\\'\\'\\'. To examine how a product works, what are specifications of its components, estimate costs and identify potential patent infringement. Acquiring sensitive data by disassembling and analysing the design of a system component.<ref name=rfc2828>Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary Another intent may be to remove copy protection, or circumvention of access restrictions.\\n \\'\\'\\'Bug fixing\\'\\'\\'. To Unofficial patch|fix (or sometimes to enhance) legacy software which is no longer supported by its creators (e.g. abandonware).\\n \\'\\'\\'Creation of unlicensed/unapproved duplicates\\'\\'\\'.  Such duplicates are sometimes called Clone (computing)|clones in the computing domain.\\n \\'\\'\\'Academic/learning purposes\\'\\'\\'. Reverse engineering for learning purposes may be to understand the key issues of an unsuccessful design and subsequently improve the design.\\n \\'\\'\\'Competitive technical intelligence\\'\\'\\'. Understand what one\\'s competitor is actually doing, versus what they say they are doing.\\n \\'\\'\\'Saving money\\'\\'\\', when one finds out what a piece of electronics is capable of, it can spare a user from purchase of a separate product.\\n \\'\\'\\'Repurposing\\'\\'\\', in which opportunities to repurpose stuff that is otherwise obsolete can be incorporated into a bigger body of utility.\\n\\n Common situations \\n\\n=Reverse engineering of machines=\\nAs computer-aided design (CAD) has become more popular, reverse engineering has become a viable method to create a 3D virtual model of an existing physical part for use in 3D CAD, Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM, computer-aided engineering|CAE or other software.{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0010-4485(96)00054-1|url=http://ralph.cs.cf.ac.uk/papers/Geometry/RE.pdf|title=Reverse engineering of geometric models–an introduction|year=1997|last1=Varady|first1=T|last2=Martin|first2=R|last3=Cox|first3=J|journal=Computer-Aided Design|volume=29|issue=4|pages=255–268}} The reverse-engineering process involves measuring an object and then reconstructing it as a 3D model. The physical object can be measured using 3D scanner|3D scanning technologies like coordinate-measuring machine|CMMs, 3D scanner#Triangulation|laser scanners, 3D scanner#Structured light|structured light digitizers, or Industrial CT Scanning (computed tomography). The measured data alone, usually represented as a point cloud, lacks topological information and is therefore often processed and modeled into a more usable format such as a triangular-faced mesh, a set of Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS surfaces, or a computer assisted design|CAD model.{{Cite web|url = http://haman-co.com|title = Haman Engineering Solutions|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}\\n\\nHybrid Modelling is commonly used term when NURBS and Solid modeling|Parametric modelling are implemented together. Using a combination of geometric and freeform surfaces can provide a powerful method of 3D modelling. Areas of freeform data can be combined with exact geometric surfaces to create a hybrid model. A typical example of this would be the reverse engineering of a cylinder head, which includes freeform cast features, such as water jackets and high tolerance machined areas.{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicaldigital.com/services/reverse-engineering/|title=Reverse Engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}\\n\\nReverse engineering is also used by businesses to bring existing physical geometry into digital product development environments, to make a digital 3D record of their own products, or to assess competitors\\' products. It is used to analyse, for instance, how a product works, what it does, and what components it consists of, estimate costs, and identify potential patent infringement, etc.\\n\\nValue engineering is a related activity also used by businesses. It involves de-constructing and analysing products, but the objective is to find opportunities for cost cutting.\\n\\n=Reverse engineering of software=\\nThe term \\'\\'reverse engineering\\'\\' as applied to software means different things to different people, prompting Chikofsky and Cross to write a paper researching the various uses and defining a Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy.

Another term for this technique is program comprehension.<ref name=\"Nelson96\"/>\\n\\nReverse engineering is a process of examination only: the software system under consideration is not modified (which would make it reengineering (software)|re-engineering). Software anti-tamper technology like Obfuscation (software)|obfuscation is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. In practice, two main types of reverse engineering emerge. In the first case, source code is already available for the software, but higher-level aspects of the program, perhaps poorly documented or documented but no longer valid, are discovered. In the second case, there is no source code available for the software, and any efforts towards discovering one possible source code for the software are regarded as reverse engineering. This second usage of the term is the one most people are familiar with. Reverse engineering of software can make use of the clean room design technique to avoid copyright infringement.\\n\\nOn a related note, black box testing in software engineering has a lot in common with reverse engineering. The tester usually has the application programming interface|API, but their goals are to find bugs and undocumented features by bashing the product from outside.{{cite book | url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/3659140732 | title=Reverse Engineering and Testing of Black-Box Software Components: by Grammatical Inference techniques | publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing | author=Shahbaz, Muzammil | year=2012 | isbn=978-3659140730}}\\n\\nOther purposes of reverse engineering include security auditing, removal of copy protection (\"software cracking|cracking\"), circumvention of access restrictions often present in consumer electronics, customization of embedded systems (such as engine management systems), in-house repairs or retrofits, enabling of additional features on low-cost \"crippled\" hardware (such as some graphics card chip-sets), or even mere satisfaction of curiosity.\\n\\nBinary software\\nThis process is sometimes termed \\'\\'Reverse Code Engineering\\'\\', or RCE.{{cite book | last=Chuvakin | first=Anton |author2=Cyrus Peikari  | edition=1st | title=Security Warrior | publisher=O\\'Reilly |date=January 2004}} As an example, decompilation of binaries for the Java platform can be accomplished using Jad.

The Wine (software)|Wine project does the same thing for the Windows API, and OpenOffice.org is one party doing this for the Microsoft Office file formats. The ReactOS project is even more ambitious in its goals, as it strives to provide binary (ABI and API) compatibility with the current Windows OSes of the NT branch, allowing software and drivers written for Windows to run on a clean-room reverse-engineered  Free Software (GPL) counterpart.  WindowsSCOPE allows for reverse-engineering the full contents of a Windows system\\'s live memory including a binary-level, graphical reverse engineering of all running processes.\\n\\nAnother classic, if not well-known example is that in 1987 Bell Laboratories reverse-engineered the Mac OS System 4.1, originally running on the Apple Macintosh SE, so they could run it on RISC machines of their own.<ref name=\"Lee2013\">{{cite book|first=Newton|last=Lee|title=Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness (2nd Edition)|url=http://www.amazon.com/Counterterrorism-Cybersecurity-Total-Information-Awareness/dp/1461472040/|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|date=2013|page=110}}\\n\\n=Binary software techniques=\\nReverse engineering of software can be accomplished by various methods.\\nThe three main groups of software reverse engineering are\\n#Analysis through observation of information exchange, most prevalent in protocol reverse engineering, which involves using bus analyzers and packet sniffers, for example, for accessing a computer bus or computer network connection and revealing the traffic data thereon. Bus or network behavior can then be analyzed to produce a stand-alone implementation that mimics that behavior. This is especially useful for reverse engineering device drivers. Sometimes, reverse engineering on embedded systems is greatly assisted by tools deliberately introduced by the manufacturer, such as JTAG ports or other debugging means. In Microsoft Windows, low-level debuggers such as SoftICE are popular.\\n#Disassembly using a disassembler, meaning the raw machine language of the program is read and understood in its own terms, only with the aid of machine-language mnemonics. This works on any computer program but can take quite some time, especially for someone not used to machine code. The Interactive Disassembler is a particularly popular tool.\\n#Decompilation using a decompiler, a process that tries, with varying results, to recreate the source code in some high-level language for a program only available in machine code or bytecode.\\n\\nSoftware classification\\nSoftware classification is the process of identifying similarities between different software binaries (for example, two different versions of the same binary) used to detect code relations between software samples. This task was traditionally done manually for several reasons (such as patch analysis for vulnerability detection and copyright infringement) but nowadays can be done somewhat automatically for large numbers of samples.\\n\\nThis method is being used mostly for long and thorough reverse engineering tasks (complete analysis of a complex algorithm or big piece of software). In general, statistical classification is considered to be a hard problem and this is also true for software classification, therefore there aren\\'t many solutions/tools that handle this task well.\\n\\n=Source code=\\nA number of Unified Modeling Language|UML tools refer to the process of importing and analysing source code to generate UML diagrams as \"reverse engineering\". See List of UML tools.\\n\\nAlthough UML is one approach to providing \"reverse engineering\" more recent advances in international standards activities have resulted in the development of the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM). This standard delivers an ontology for the intermediate (or abstracted) representation of programming language constructs and their interrelationships.  An Object Management Group standard (on its way to becoming an ISO standard as well), KDM has started to take hold in industry with the development of tools and analysis environments which can deliver the  extraction and analysis of source, binary, and byte code. For source code analysis, KDM\\'s granular standards\\' architecture enables the extraction of software system flows (data, control, & call maps), architectures, and business layer knowledge (rules, terms, process). The standard enables the use of a common data format (XMI) enabling the correlation of the various layers of system knowledge for either detailed analysis (e.g. root cause, impact) or derived analysis (e.g. business process extraction).  Although efforts to represent language constructs can be never-ending given the number of languages, the continuous evolution of software languages and the development of new languages, the standard does allow for the use of extensions to support the broad language set as well as evolution. KDM is compatible with UML, BPMN, RDF and other standards enabling migration into other environments and thus leverage system knowledge for efforts such as software system transformation and enterprise business layer analysis.\\n\\n=Reverse engineering of protocols=\\n\\nCommunications protocol|Protocols are sets of rules that describe message formats and how messages are exchanged (i.e., the protocol Finite-state machine|state-machine). Accordingly, the problem of protocol reverse-engineering can be partitioned into two subproblems; message format and state-machine reverse-engineering.\\n\\nThe message formats have traditionally been reverse-engineered through a tedious manual process, which involved analysis of how protocol implementations process messages, but recent research proposed a number of automatic solutions.W.

Typically, these automatic approaches either group observed messages into clusters using various Cluster analysis|clustering analyses, or emulate the protocol implementation tracing the message processing.\\n\\nThere has been less work on reverse-engineering of state-machines of protocols. In general, the protocol state-machines can be learned either through a process of offline learning, which passively observes communication and attempts to build the most general state-machine accepting all observed sequences of messages, and online machine learning|online learning, which allows interactive generation of probing sequences of messages and listening to responses to those probing sequences.

The attacker grinds away layer after layer of the smart card and takes pictures with an electron microscope. With this technique, it is possible to reveal the complete hardware and software part of the smart card. The major problem for the attacker is to bring everything into the right order to find out how everything works. The makers of the card try to hide keys and operations by mixing up memory positions, for example, bus scrambling.Wolfgang Rankl, Wolfgang Effing, Smart Card Handbook (2004)T. Welz: [http://www.crypto.rub.de/its_seminar_ws0708.html Smart cards as methods for payment] (2008), Seminar ITS-Security Ruhr-Universität Bochum\\nIn some cases, it is even possible to attach a probe to measure voltages while the smart card is still operational. The makers of the card employ sensors to detect and prevent this attack.David C. Musker: [http://www.jenkins.eu/articles-general/reverse-engineering.asp Protecting & Exploiting Intellectual Property in Electronics], IBC Conferences, 10 June 1998 This attack is not very common because it requires a large investment in effort and special equipment that is generally only available to large chip manufacturers. Furthermore, the payoff from this attack is low since other security techniques are often employed such as shadow accounts.  It is uncertain at this time whether attacks against CHIP/PIN cards to replicate encryption data and consequentially crack PINS would provide a cost effective attack on multifactor authentication.\\n\\n=Reverse engineering for military applications=\\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2014}}\\nReverse engineering is often used by people in order to copy other nations\\' technologies, devices, or information that have been obtained by regular troops in the fields or by military intelligence|intelligence operations.

They reverse-engineered copies of those cans. The cans were popularly known as \"Jerry cans\".\\nPanzerschreck: The Germans captured an American Bazooka during World War II, and reverse engineered it to create the larger Panzerschreck.\\n Tupolev Tu-4: In 1944, three American B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bombers on missions over Japan were forced to land in the Soviet Union|USSR.

A limited exemption exists that allows the knowledge thus gained to be shared and used for interoperability purposes. The section states:\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n(f) Reverse Engineering.—<br /><br />\\n (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention, to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute infringement under this title.<br /><br />\\n (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure, or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability, to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.<br /><br />\\n (3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or violate applicable law other than this section.<br /><br />\\n (4) For purposes of this subsection, the term 「interoperability」 means the ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs mutually to use the information which has been exchanged. \\n</blockquote>\\n\\n=European Union=\\n\\nEU Directive 2009/24, on the legal protection of computer programs, governs reverse engineering in the European Union.

Nevertheless, circumstances may exist when such a reproduction of the code and translation of its form are indispensable to obtain the necessary information to achieve the interoperability of an independently created program with other programs. It has therefore to be considered that, in these limited circumstances only, performance of the acts of reproduction and translation by or on behalf of a person having a right to use a copy of the program is legitimate and compatible with fair practice and must therefore be deemed not to require the authorisation of the rightholder. An objective of this exception is to make it possible to connect all components of a computer system, including those of different manufacturers, so that they can work together. Such an exception to the author\\'s exclusive rights may not be used in a way which prejudices the legitimate interests of the rightholder or which conflicts with a normal exploitation of the program.\\n</blockquote>\\n\\nThis superseded an earlier 1991 Directive.[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31991L0250:EN:HTML Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs].

The arrows indicate information flow.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Computer software\\'\\'\\', or simply \\'\\'\\'software\\'\\'\\', is that part of a computer system that consists of data (computing)|data or computer instructions, in contrast to the Computer hardware|physical hardware from which the system is built. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, Computer program|programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, Library (computing)|libraries and related non-executable Data (computing)|data, such as Software documentation|online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.\\n\\nAt the lowest level, executable code consists of Machine code|machine language instructions specific to an individual Microprocessor|processor—typically a central processing unit (CPU). A machine language consists of groups of Binary numbers|binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction may also (indirectly) cause something to appear on a display of the computer system—a state change which should be visible to the user. The processor carries out the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to branch instruction|\"jump\" to a different instruction, or is interrupted (by now multi-core processors are dominant, where each core can run instructions in order; then, however, each application software runs only on one core by default, but some software has been made to run on many).\\n\\nThe majority of software is written in high-level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for programmers, meaning closer to a natural language.{{cite web|title=Compiler construction|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO}} High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an Interpreter (computing)|interpreter or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, essentially, a vaguely mnemonic representation of a machine language using a natural language alphabet, which is translated into machine language using an Assembly language|assembler.\\n\\nHistory\\n{{Main article|History of software}}\\nAn outline (algorithm) for what would have been the first piece of software was written by Ada Lovelace in the 19th century, for the planned Analytical Engine. However, neither the Analytical Engine nor any software for it were ever created.\\n\\nThe first theory about software—prior to creation of computers as we know them today—was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1935 essay \\'\\'Computable numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem\\'\\' (decision problem).\\n\\nThis eventually led to the creation of the twin academic fields of computer science and software engineering, which both study software and its creation. Computer science is more theoretical (Turing\\'s essay is an example of computer science), where as software engineering focuses on more practical concerns.\\n\\nHowever, prior to 1946, software as we now understand it—programs stored in the memory of stored-program digital computers—did not yet exist. The first electronic computing devices were instead rewired in order to \"reprogram\" them.\\n\\nTypes of software\\n{{See also|List of software categories}}\\n\\nOn virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories. \\n\\n=Purpose, or domain of use=\\nBased on the goal, computer software can be divided into:\\n\\n \\'\\'Application software\\'\\', which is software that uses the computer system to perform special functions or provide video game|entertainment functions beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. There are many different types of application software, because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large—see list of software.\\n \\'\\'System software\\'\\', which is software that directly operates the computer hardware, to provide basic functionality needed by users and other software, and to provide a platform for running application software.{{cite web|title=System Software|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010530092843/http://home.olemiss.edu:80/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2001-05-30|publisher=The University of Mississippi}} System software includes:\\n \\'\\'Operating systems\\'\\', which are essential collections of software that manage resources and provides common services for other software that runs \"on top\" of them. Supervisory programs, boot loaders, shell (computing)|shells and window systems are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has an operating system.\\n \\'\\'Device drivers\\'\\', which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.\\n \\'\\'Software utility|Utilities\\'\\', which are computer programs designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.\\n \\'\\'Malicious software\\'\\' or \\'\\'malware\\'\\', which is software that is developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as practical jokes.\\n\\n=Nature or domain of execution=\\n Desktop applications such as web browsers and Microsoft Office, as well as smartphone and Tablet computer|tablet applications (called \"mobile app|apps\"). (There is a push in some parts of the software industry to merge desktop applications with mobile apps, to some extent. Windows 8, and later Ubuntu Touch, tried to allow the same style of application user interface to be used on desktops, laptops and mobiles.)\\n JavaScript scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in web pages that are run directly inside the web browser when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is ActionScript scripts, which are supported by the Adobe Flash plugin.\\n Server software, including:\\n Web applications, which usually run on the web server and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. PHP, Java (programming language)|Java, ASP.NET, or even Node.js|JavaScript that runs on the server. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.\\n Plug-in (computing)|Plugins and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;\\n Embedded software resides as firmware within embedded systems, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as cars and televisions (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can \\'\\'themselves\\'\\' be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).{{cite web|title=Embedded Software—Technologies and Trends|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=May–June 2009|accessdate=6 November 2013}} In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run embedded operating systems, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed, application which is always run).\\n Microcode is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor \\'\\'itself\\'\\' how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code. It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.\\n\\n=Programming tools=\\n{{Main article|Programming tool}}\\nProgramming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that software developers (also known as \\'\\'programmers, coders, hackers\\'\\' or \\'\\'software engineers\\'\\') use to create, Debugging|debug, Software maintenance|maintain (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise Technical support|support software. Software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as compilers, debuggers, interpreter (computing)|interpreters, linker (computing)|linkers, and text editors, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an integrated development environment (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.\\n\\nSoftware topics\\n\\n=Architecture=\\n{{See also|Software architecture}}\\nUsers often see things differently from programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to embedded systems, analog computers and supercomputers) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.\\n\\n Platform software: The Platform (computing)|Platform includes the firmware, device drivers, an operating system, and typically a graphical user interface which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its peripherals (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a Personal computer|PC one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.\\n Application software: Application software or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. Application software is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other \"system software\" as applications.\\n User-written software: End-user development tailors systems to meet users\\' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and word processor templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.\\n\\n=Execution=\\n{{Main article|Execution (computing)}}\\nComputer software has to be \"loaded\" into the computer storage|computer\\'s storage (such as the hard drive or Computer memory|memory). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to \\'\\'execute\\'\\' the software. This involves passing instruction (computer science)|instructions from the application software, through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as machine language|machine code. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation—moving data (computing)|data, carrying out a computation, or altering the control flow of instructions.\\n\\nData movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using \"pointers\" to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.\\n\\n<!-- This section is simply to long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the article itself.\\n\\nInstructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an \"if\" statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a \"loop.\" Often, one instruction may \"call\" another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or module (programming)|module. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.\\n\\nA simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as \"Copy\" from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a \\'document\\' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a \\'clipboard\\' data area. If a different menu entry such as \"Paste\" is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.\\n\\nDepending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful computer system.\\n\\nCurrently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art— especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\\n\\nKinds of software by operation: computer program as executable, source code or script (computer programming)|script, computer configuration|configuration.-->\\n\\n=Quality and reliability=\\n{{Main article|Software quality|Software testing|Software reliability}}\\nSoftware quality is very important, especially for commercial software|commercial and system software like Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows and Linux. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person\\'s work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called \"Software bug|bugs\" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing. Software is often also a victim to what is known as software aging, the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.\\n\\nMany bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through software testing. However, software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates every bug; some programmers say that \"every program has at least one more bug\" (Lubarsky\\'s Law).<ref name=\"github\">{{cite web| url=https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | title=scripting intelligence book examples }} In the Waterfall model|waterfall method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed agile software development, developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. Software can be tested through unit testing, regression testing and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, NASA has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.\\n\\n=License=\\n{{Main article|Software license}}\\nThe software\\'s license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of free software licenses, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.\\n\\nProprietary software can be divided into two types:\\n\\n freeware, which includes the category of \"free trial\" software or \"freemium\" software (in the past, the term shareware was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used for free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.\\n software available for a fee, often inaccurately termed \"commercial software\", which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.\\n\\nOpen source software, on the other hand, comes with a free software license, granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.\\n\\n=Patents=\\n{{Main article|Software patent|Software patent debate}}\\nSoftware patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a \\'\\'detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement\\'\\' a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could \\'\\'do\\'\\', and user \\'\\'requirements\\'\\', are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either—the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid—although since \\'\\'all\\'\\' useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate.\\n\\nSoftware patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers—for example the patent for Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), which purported to claim rights over \\'\\'any\\'\\' programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.\\n\\nDesign and implementation\\n{{Main article|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}\\nDesign and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of Microsoft Word took much more time than designing and developing Microsoft Notepad because the latter has much more basic functionality.\\n\\nSoftware is usually designed and created (aka coded/written/programmed) in integrated development environments (IDE) like Eclipse (software)|Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA|IntelliJ and Microsoft Visual Studio that can simplify the process and compiler|compile the software (if applicable). As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the application programming interface (API) that the underlying software provides like GTK+, JavaBeans or Swing (Java)|Swing. Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the Spring framework|Spring Framework is used for implementing enterprise applications, the Windows Forms library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like Microsoft Word, and Windows Communication Foundation is used for designing web services. When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, if a user is designing a Microsoft Windows desktop application, he or she might use the .NET Framework|.NET Windows Forms library to design the desktop application and call its APIs like \\'\\'Form1.Close()\\'\\' and \\'\\'Form1.Show()\\'\\'{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx | title=MSDN Library|accessdate=2010-06-14}} to close or open the application, and write the additional operations him/herself that it needs to have. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these APIs him/herself. Companies like Oracle Corporation|Oracle and Microsoft provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their Library (computing)|software libraries that usually have numerous APIs in them.\\n\\nData structures such as hash tables, array data type|arrays, and binary trees, and algorithms such as quicksort, can be useful for creating software.\\n\\nComputer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.{{Specify|Which characteristics?|date=May 2012}}{{cite journal|author=v. Engelhardt, Sebastian |year=2008|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html |title=The Economic Properties of Software|journal= Jena Economic Research Papers| volume= 2| issue= 2008–045.}}{{cite web|url=http://dankaminsky.com/1999/03/02/69/ |title=Why Open Source Is The Optimum Economic Paradigm for Software|first= Dan |last=Kaminsky |year=1999}}\\n\\nA person who creates software is called a programmer, software engineer or software developer, terms that all have a similar meaning. More informal terms for programmer also exist such as \"coder\" and \"Hacker (expert)|\\'\\'\\'hacker\\'\\'\\'\"{{Spaced ndash}}although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean Hacker (computer security)|someone who illegally breaks into computer systems.\\n\\nIndustry and organizations\\n{{Main article|Software industry}}\\nA great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft was the richest person in the world in 2009, largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office software products.\\n\\nNon-profit software organizations include the Free Software Foundation, GNU Project and Mozilla Foundation. Software standard organizations like the W3C, IETF develop recommended software standards such as XML, HTTP and HTML, so that software can interoperate through these standards.\\n\\nOther well-known large software companies include Oracle Corporation|Oracle, Novell, SAP AG|SAP, Symantec, Adobe Systems, and Corel, while small companies often provide innovation.\\n\\nSee also\\n Software release life cycle\\n Independent software vendor\\n List of software\\n Software asset management\\n{{portal bar|Software|Free software|Information technology}}\\n\\nReferences\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\nExternal links\\n{{Sister project links | wikt=software | commons=Special:Search/Software | b= | n= | s= | v=Computer Software | voy= |q=no}}\\n {{dmoz|Computers/Software}}<!--ref name=\"github\"/-->\\n\\n{{Software digital distribution platforms|state=collapsed}}\\n{{Authority control}}\\n\\nCategory:Computing\\nCategory:Computer science\\nCategory:Software| \\n\\n'\n",
